2) Filter by Programming Language: Easily filter projects by programming language to ensure they are suitable for beginners' skills.

3) Browse Project Details: Access detailed information about each project, including a brief description and recent issues, as well as a link to the project itself.

4) Sorting: Sort by number of stars and number of forks to find the optimal open-source project.
